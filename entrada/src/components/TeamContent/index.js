              Prior to founding Entrada, Anthony spent his time managing travel for artist and entertainer Drake, who he still works with today in a multitude of capacities. His journey has taken him across the globe several times, organizing complicated logistics for large groups. That first-hand experience and awareness of the ever-changing complexities of elite travel is what spurred him to take his experience public. An avid meditator and yoga practitioner, Anthony enjoys all things creative.

                With a degree in Neuroscience from Amherst College, Tony has always been interested in how things work and how to make them better.

Itâ€™s that eye for detail, operational know-how, and ability to manage complex systems that make him such an invaluable part of the Entrada team.
